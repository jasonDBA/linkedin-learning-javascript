## How JS loads?
NOTE: The below, both are only for external JS script
* Asynchronous: it specifies that the script will be executed asynchronously as soon as it is available.
* Deferred : it makes the browser wait until the document is loaded before running the JavaScript
```
<script src="" async></script>
<script src="" defer></script>
```
